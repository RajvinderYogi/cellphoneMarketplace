<h1> Cell Phones Marketplace - Assignment 2</h1>
<h3> This web application is built for Assignment-2(Advanced Server Side Scripting - COMP2106) at Georgian College</h3>
<p>It includes the crud functionality for different cell phones from different brands.</p>
<p>For now it has only one page working (apple phone page). But at the end result would include othe brands too. It would include registr, login and logout abilities.</p> 
<p>Currently, I am using Bootstrap template v4.0 tofor this application, but i am looking forward to include my own css and if i can find a template to make website attractive.</p>
<p>This website is deployed on herokuapp. Please visit:<a href="https://cellphonemarketplace.herokuapp.com/">Cell Phone Marketplace</a>, to view a live version of this website built so far.</p>
